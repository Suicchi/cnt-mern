Project is deployed here: https://cnt.herokuapp.com/

The name CNT doesn't have any special meanings to it. Just planned to add chat note and todo functionality with MERN stack. Just trying to have fun as much as I can.

The update may not be regular as I am trying to take a slow approach. I have FE exam and Japanese Language Proficiency Test N1 level to take. So I am also having to allocate my time for those two as well. 

The features will be modified as I go but right now this will only have todo and notes functionality.
